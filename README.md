# Turing_Machine_Model
A java desktop application simulates Turing Machine, that is really EASY to design control rule/ command/ program of Turing Machine with the DEBUG model.

#Functions and features
## Real-time mark current status and control rules corresponding to characters
When the Turing machine is running, the control rule corresponding to the current state and symbol is highlighted in real time.
## Debug mode
As Debug mode of normal IDE, the Debug mode of this application includes breakpoint, next step, last step and continue.
## Automatically check the completeness of control rules
If a row of control rules is not complete or a new state is never defined, Warn or Error will be suggested at the bottom of the user interface.
