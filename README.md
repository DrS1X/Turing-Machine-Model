# Turing_Machine_Model
A java desktop application simulates Turing Machine, that is really EASY to design control rule/ command/ program of Turing Machine with the DEBUG model.

# Functions and features
## 1.Process Visualization
The control rule corresponding to the current state and symbol is highlighted in real time, when the Turing machine is running.
## 2.Debug mode
As Debug mode of normal IDE, the Debug mode of this application includes breakpoint, next step, last step and continue.
## 3.Automatically check the completeness of control rules
If a row of control rules is not complete or a new state is never defined, Warn or Error will be displayed at the bottom of the user interface.
## 4.Export or import control rules
Control rules can be exported or imported as txt file. _There is 5 rule files in 'rules' folder_.
